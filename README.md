Mental health issues are one of the biggest problems in the world, particularly in India. Depression among youth is especially common due to factors like pressure, competition and many other factors and most of the times these issues are not detected which may lead to harmful situations. Here social media comes to play. They can be used to detect issues like depression, anxiety and others from tweets or comments. 
In this project, I have used tweets to check for depression. I have used CNN and LSTM algorithm which provides way more accuracy. The dataset is something that I want to improve as well because there are very little datasets of depressing tweets and they are also not easily available for usage. Currently, I used sentiment analysis tweets dataset for random tweets and I have processed the depressive tweets.
